## Local build steps:
1. Clone repo locally
2. Open the terminal and execute `npm install` from the root directory
3. Then execute `npm run watch`
  -> This will build all JS files and watch them for code changed
4. Open a new terminal tab/session, navigate to the root directory of the repo. Execute `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
  -> This will host the webpage locally at port `8000` by default
5. Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser
